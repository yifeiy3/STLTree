The environment used to generate our data:

Devices: LightSensor, type: digits, possible state: [0 - 100]
         LightA, type: string, possible state: [on, off]
         LightB, type: string, possible state: [on, off]
         Temperature, type: digits, possible state: [0 - 100]
         AC, type: string, possible state: [on, off]
         window, type: string, possible state: [open, closed]

Rules:
    LightSensor > 8 ---------> Light A off, Light B off 
    LightSensor < 6, Temperature > 85 ---------> LightB on 
    Temperature > 85 for 4 seconds, AC off ---------> window open 
    AC on ---------> window closed after 2 seconds 
    Temperature < 60 for 3 seconds ------------> window closed, AC on 

Temperature randomly (+- 1 every second)
LightSensor randomly (+- 1 every second)
Light A, Light B can be randomly turned on 
Window randomly open/closed
AC randomly on/off
